# Pokemon Lab
Files Needed
- `pokemon.csv`
- `pokemon.html`
- `pokemon.py`

## Part I: Using Python to Generate a Webpage
```html
<html>
  <body>
    <div>NY Times</div>
    <img src="https://www.nytco.com/wp-content/themes/nytco/images/nytco/NYT-wordmark.png">
  </body>
</html>
```
The sample HTML code above is really just a long string. Write a python function that receives two strings: a title and an image link and produces an html page with the title placed in between `div` tags and the image link inserted after the `src` attribute within an `img` tag.
1. Create a `.py` file to start.
2. Write to an `.html` file. Use `open()`.
3. Make a helper function `makeDivTag(material)` that receives a string that gets placed in between the opening and closing `div` tags as a string.
4. Make a helper function `makeImgTag(link)` that receives a string that gets placed inside the `src` attribute.
5. Write a function `makeWebpage(content)` that makes the `html` and `body` tags and calls the two helper functions you created to put together the html page you see above. You will need a variable that starts off as an empty string that you keep adding to create the content that goes in between the `body` tags.
6. Your HTML code should be a giant string. Once you're done building out the string, then write the string to your `.html` file.

## Part II: Generating a Webpage from a CSV File
#### Pokemon Image Maker
```html
<img src=https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/x-y/normal/POKEMON_NAME.png>
```
1. Substitute 3 other names from the `.csv` file to where `POKEMON_NAME` is.
2. Navigate to the link in your web browser to see if the image link actually works.
3. Make a `makePokemonImgTag(pokemonName)` that uses your `makeImgTag()` function. But now, you have to manipulate the `link` to be able to accept different names.
```python
makPokemonImgTag("bulbasaur") # returns "https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/x-y/normal/bulbasaur.png"
makPokemonImgTag("charmander") # returns "https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/x-y/normal/charmander.png"
```

#### Reading from a CSV File
1. Make a function `makePokemonWebPage()` that opens the `pokemon.csv` file. Download the `.csv` file [here](pokemon.csv) by selecting the raw button and right clicking to save as.
2. Use the `makeWebPage()` inside.
3. Read through the lines of the `pokemon.csv` using the appropriate method.
3. Loop through the lines extracting the name of the Pokemon.
4. Pass the name of the Pokemon to your `makePokemonImgTag()` function.
5. Insert all the `img` tags you're making in the loop to the content that you pass to the `makeWebPage()`. If it works, your webpage should look something like:
![image](pokemon.png)
6. Add a `div` tag containing each pokemon's name next to their image using `makeDivTag()` function.
![another_image](names.png)

#### Adding CSS
```CSS
.grass {
  color: green
}
```
1. Make a `.css file` and pick a color for each Pokemon Type.
2. Write a function that replaces the `<div>` for the Pokemon's name with `<div class="TYPE">`
3. The CSS file should style the color of the text to reflect the type of the Pokemon. For example, a grass type Pokemon should be green. Fire should be red. Water should be blue...
