# GitHub Pages

## Steps
1) Make a GitHub account.
2) Create a new repository named `<username>.github.io`. DO NOT FORGET TO CHECK the box to `Initialize this repository with a README`!!!
3) Upload a file named `index.html` to the repo.
4) Type `<username>.github.io` in the address bar of your browser. Your stuff is live! (it might actually take a few minutes to go live)
