# Project Euler

## Multiple Variable Assignment
You can use commas to separate variables.
```python
a = 1
b = 2
a, b = b, a
```

## How to get indices in a for loop
You need to use commas and the `enumerate` function.
```python
pokemon = ["bulbasaur", "charmander", "squirtle"]
for idx, val in enumerate(pokemon):
  print idx, val
```

1) Sign up for an account here: https://projecteuler.net/archives
2) Work with the person next to you
3) No coding at all
4) Come up with a detailed approach for problems 1 through 10
5) Compare your approaches with the group next to you or behind you or near year
6) Pick 5 problems to actually code and find the answer!
