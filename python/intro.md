# String Basics

## String Index
```python
"hello world"[0] #returns "h"
"hello world"[3] #returns "l"
"hello world"[-3] #returns "r"
```

## Variable Declaration
```python
variable_name = <some value>
```

## Variable Naming Conventions
**according to python.org**

- Never use the characters 'l' (lowercase letter el), 'O' (uppercase letter oh), or 'I' (uppercase letter eye) as single character variable names.
- Function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability.
- Variable names follow the same convention as function names.
- mixedCase is allowed only in contexts where that's already the prevailing style (e.g. threading.py), to retain backwards compatibility.

## Activity
- Download or copy the file [string1.py](string1.py).
- Run the file by navigating to the file through the terminal and running `python string1.py`
- Make sure that all the tests pass.
