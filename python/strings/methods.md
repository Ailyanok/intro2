# String Methods

## String Index
```python
"hello world"[0]
"hello world"[3]
"hello world"[-3]
```

## General String methods
```python
"string".method()
```

## Slice
i NEVER memorize the slice method instead if I ever need to use it - i come up with a bunch of test cases and test them out in the python shell and discern their behavior.
```python
slice
```
