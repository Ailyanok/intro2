# Iterating through a String

## Structure
```python
var = 0
while var < 10:
  print var
  var = var + 1
```

The code above prints out the numbers 0 through 9. Why doesn't it print out 10?

1. Write a function that prints out all the letters of a string.
2. Write a function that can check to see if a string is a palindrome.
  - the easiest way is to use the built in string method .reverse()
  - do it without reversing the string at all
